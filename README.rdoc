== Flatten

Flatten is a small framework for document-oriented secondary persistence of
Ruby objects. Its purpose is to provide an alternative to caching for
optimization of applications whose content is described by complex relational
structures but fits readily into a document-oriented paradigm.

Flatten is a work in progress.
